         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <list>
               <item>I. That all people may be encouraged to keep the Markets in the Towns where any of Their Majeſties Forces do Quarter this Winter, I do ſtrictly Charge and Command all Soldiers of the Army, not to take any thing from the Inhabitants of the Country upon any pretence whatſoever; but duly pay ſuch Rates for the Proviſions they ſhall ſtand in need of, as are appointed by the Lords-Juſtices of <hi>Ireland,</hi> under Penalty of the Officers, to whoſe Troop or Company ſuch Souldier ſhall belong, paying treble what ſhall be ſo taken, and the Souldiers being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded againſt according to His Majeſties Proclamation Dated at <hi>Lought rickland,</hi> the 24th of <hi>June</hi> laſt.</item>

               <item>III. That the Outrages that are and have been committed by the Straglers from the Army, may be for the future prevented, I require all Officers to put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution the Order made at <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> the 9th of <hi>October,</hi> calling all Souldiers back to their reſpective Regiments, and forbidding them to leave the ſame again with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Paſs from the Officer Commanding the Regiment in Chief, under the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of being proceeded againſt as Deſerters.</item>

That all pretence may be taken away from the Inhabitants of the Country, not to bring in their Hay and Oats into the places appointed in the reſpective Quarters, for the making Magazines for the Winter, and other places where the Horſe and Dragoons are Quartered, I ſtrictly Charge and Command all Officers not to permit their Soldiers to go out a Forraging without Leave firſt had from my Self, or the General Officer Commanding in Chief in that Quarter, in Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, as they will anſwer the contrary.</item>
               <item>V.

               <item>VII And that the Counties may know what Quantities of Forrage they are to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide this Winter, the Officer Commanding in Chief in each Barony, shall deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Sheriff of the reſpective County, or ſuch Perſon or Perſons, as are or shall be appointed to take care of the ſame, the numbers of Horſe and Dragoons, that are Quarter'd therein, for which they shall be oblig'd to furniſh after the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
